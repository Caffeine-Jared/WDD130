        <p>
            My name is Jared Linares. I'm from New Jersey. Some of my favorite anime are One Piece, Hunter x Hunter, Jormungand, and Grand
            Blue. Technology is a passion of mine, and I love learning new things. I hope to get better at web development as I go through this course. Don't be fooled by the photo, most of the time I look like a zombie.
