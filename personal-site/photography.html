                        <p class="rocks-content">Back when I was first getting into photography, I found my dad's old camera and 
                            started taking as many pictures as I could. Since my family lived near the beach, I often
                            found myself taking lots of pictures of the wildlife and scenery that made the beach so special to me.
                            This photo in particular is one that I'm especially proud of, since it was the first photo that really showed
                            the improvement from beginner to seasoned beginner.

                        <p class="morning-content">
                            When I came back from my mission, I took every opportunity that I could to get out and explore the beach. 
                            There was one time where I woke up at 4 am to get a photo of the sunrise. Getting up that early allowed me to see the
                            many fishing boats, and fishermen either going out or coming back into shore after a long night of fishing.

                            One of the great things about Sandy Hook, is that there are tons of conservation efforts made by the Coast Guard, and NOAA, 
                            to protect the native species found lurking along the shores and in the tall beach grass that covers the sand dunes. Taking photos 
                            of these little birds was a special treat since they typically retreat to the dunes when all the tourists arrive at the beach.

                        <p class="boat-content">There is something really calming about watching fishing boats come in after what seems like a long night of fishing. Additionally, being 
                            able to visit the local fish mongers and order fresh fish is something I love. This photo taken in the early morning is probably one of 
                            my favorite shots.

                        <p class="woo-content">This is one of the best photos I've taken hands down. With the type of equipment that I had that day, and the quality 
                            of this photo being what it is, all I could say was "Wow". It was on a summer evening that I decided to go out 
                            to a local park and take some photos by the lake. Those streaks of light come from passing cars, and a longer exposure setting.
