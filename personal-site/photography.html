                            <p>Back when I was first getting into photography, I found my dad's old camera and 
                                started taking as many pictures as I could. Since my family lived near the beach, I often
                                found myself taking lots of pictures of the wildlife and scenery that made the beach so special to me.
                                This photo in particular is one that I'm especially proud of, since it was the first photo that really showed
                                the improvement from beginner to seasoned beginner.
                            </p>

                        <p>
                            When I came back from my mission, I took every opportunity that I could to get out and explore the beach. 
                            There was one time where I woke up at 4 am to get a photo of the sunrise. Getting up that early allowed me to see the
                            many fishing boats, and fishermen either going out or coming back into shore after a long night of fishing. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            One of the great things about Sandy Hook, is that there are tons of conservation efforts made by the Coast Guard, and NOAA, 
                            to protect the native species found lurking along the shores and in the tall beach grass that covers the sand dunes. Taking photos 
                            of these little birds was a special treat since they typically retreat to the dunes when all the tourists arrive at the beach.

                        <img src="images/boat.jpeg" alt="boat" style="width: 500px;">
                        <p>There is something really calming about watching fishing boats come in after what seems like a long night of fishing. Additionally, being 
                            able to visit the local fish mongers and order fresh fish is something I love. This photo taken in the early morning is probably one of 
                            my favorite shots.

                        <p>When I was a kid, my grandmother would often have ice cream from this little boardwalk italian ice place. I remember loving the lemon italian ice with vanilla custard. That flavor will forever be engrained in my memory as summer.</p>

                        <p>NYC is where dreams and aspirations either come true or die. There is no middle ground. Getting the chance to live in NYC and 
                            work is something that I hope to do once I'm out of college.

                        <p>Looking out from NJ to NYC, I get excited thinking about the possibilities that could be found across the water, the people I'd
                            come across, and the dreams I hope to achieve. Those glowing lights are something I hope to be a part of one day.

                        <img src="images/woo.jpg" alt="woo" style="width: 500px;">
                        <p>This is one of the best photos I've taken hands down. With the type of equipment that I had that day, and the quality 
                            of this photo being what it is, all I could say was "Wow". It was on a summer evening that I decided to go out 
                            to a local park and take some photos by the lake. Those streaks of light come from passing cars, and a longer exposure setting.
